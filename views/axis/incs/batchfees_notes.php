Notes<br />
1) Order of Priority - 1) Ticked Students, 2) Classroom, 3) Level <br />
> Meaning only if a) no ticked students and b) no classroom set, 
then will the fees be applied to all the students in the selected level. <br />
2) Num - default is 1, if the same feetype exists already, like tutorial, then put 2 to have both tutorial fees setup. <br />
3) Amount default is the amount set in the fees lookup table, but can be overridden here.
